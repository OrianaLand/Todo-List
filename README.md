## ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://orianaland.github.io/Todo-List/)

## Project Description

Interactive todo-list app built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Tracks tasks with add, edit, delete, and mark-as-complete features. A practice project from The Odin Project to sharpen DOM manipulation and JavaScript skills.

## Key Features

- **Project Organization:** Create multiple projects to organize your todos
- **Priority System:** Mark tasks as High, Medium, or Low priority with visual indicators
- **Smart Categories:** Built-in filters for Today, This Week, and Completed tasks
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between color themes for comfortable use
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Data Persistence:** Todos are saved to localStorage so they persist between sessions
- **Intuitive UI:** Clean, modern interface with smooth animations

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** JavaScript (ES6 Modules), HTML5, CSS3
- **Date Handling:** date-fns library for date manipulation and formatting
- **Icons:** Font Awesome for a comprehensive icon set
- **Storage:** Web Storage API (localStorage) for data persistence
- **Build Tool:** Webpack for module bundling

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer (todoItem.js, categories.js, todoStorage.js):**
  - Handles todo and category object creation
  - Manages data persistence using localStorage
  - Implements the Web Storage API with proper error handling
- **Business Logic Layer (todoList.js):**
  - Manages todo operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Handles category management
  - Implements filtering and sorting logic
- **Presentation Layer (todoDOM.js, styles.css):**
  - Renders todos and categories to the DOM
  - Handles user interactions
  - Implements responsive design and animations

## UI/UX Features

- **Visual Priority Indicators:** Color-coded dots (red, yellow, green) for task priority
- **Smooth Transitions:** CSS transitions for all interactive elements
- **Custom Checkboxes:** Styled checkboxes with animation effects
- **Collapsible Sidebar:** Save screen space when needed
- **Modal Dialogs:** Clean forms for adding/editing todos and projects
- **Scrollable Lists:** Handles large numbers of todos efficiently

## Development Notes

This project was an excellent opportunity to:

- Practice JavaScript module patterns and separation of concerns
- Implement factory functions and class-based object creation
- Work with the Web Storage API for data persistence
- Utilize date-fns library for date manipulation and formatting
- Create a responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Implement dark/light mode theming with CSS custom properties
- Build accessible modal dialogs and form validation
- Manage complex state transitions between different views
- Implement a collapsible sidebar with smooth animations
- Practice event delegation for efficient DOM handling
- Create a priority system with visual indicators
- Develop a project-based organizational structure for todos
- Implement local storage with proper error handling and data validation
